# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Jianzheng Ruan

## Context
We have finally reached the end of building our freedom project. There were a lot of obstacles I faced but most of them were solved and gained a lot of knowledge from. The main purpose of my freedom project idea with the tool A-frame  is to make life easier for engineers, especially those in the architecture field.  Architects sit in the office all day trying to draw out the best design for their clients but of course there will always be a huge waste of papers and time. So I was like why not use an Aframe tool and code the design into a scene, this way trees won’t be killed just to make extra paper to engineer and a lot more time will be saved for them. In this blog, I will be mainly talking about what inspired me to pick this tool and how I applied Javascript with Aframe and also how I planned out my presentation to the classroom.

I started off as an helper in an electrical company to someone now that’s full on with electricity and building designs. The reason being I have that passion of me building something and testing the final result. The accomplishment I gain from that is unmeasurable. Using the tool a-frame and some Javascript  I was able to build my farm house. And here is how it [looks](https://jianzhengr3591.github.io/A-frame-house/). You use arrow keys and mouse pad to control the motion and the view of your position in the scene. I was able to build this without crumbling a stack of printing papers, which means I saved so many trees during the period of making my freedom project. And not only that, with the power of javascript i was able to create a fence with many blocks just within a few lines of codes. Rather than coding each box out with a different position. So big shout out to “for loop”. No matter how powerful a tool can be, it always has a positive and negative impact on society. One positive effect is that engineers can erase things nice and clean compared to real life. When you erase something there will be left over marks. And one negative effect will have on us is that the culture of architecture will be replaced with technology, which is not the fundamental of architecture engineering because they start off on a piece of paper and draw their thoughts out on the paper. So although we did cut off the paper waste but we kinda left the culture behind and violated the rule of it. 

Here is how I presented my freedom project to my classmates. I first started off with the idea that inspired me, which is building a 3D scene into a web design without crumbling so many papers and killing trees. Then I told my classmates why I chose this tool and how it might help me later on with my major in college or career later on in life. After explaining this, I then explained to my classmates that I use a for loop from a Javascript course to help to add a fence around my farm house, which caught many classmates' attention, because they thought I would code out each individual block with different positions. But instead I just used a loop with variables and I was able to code out many blocks at different positions. And towards the end, I was able to show everyone the functionality of my project and they understood how this tool I chose will help me and protect our mother nature from falling apart.

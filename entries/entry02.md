##### AFter learning about the funtamental of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), I now have moved on to another stage of the freedom project , which is to apply the funtamental elements into the started code. Something I thought that can help me to organzie all these codes will be to create a new parent folder in my [idecs50] https://ide.cs50.io/13758b3009c14fb0964b54fd27439218). As for now I didn't write out any javsciopt codes yet because I want do this step by step, which is to write out the complex code out at first and then refactor it using loops, so that way I can see every process along my way. The very first funtemental elemnet I applied inside my `hmtl` codes is the position of geomentritic shapes. Aframe foucs a lot on positioning, because is a building struture which measn that you might see the same shape being used in many other poisitions

##### AFter learning about the funtamental of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), I now have moved on to another stage of the freedom project , which is to apply the funtamental elements into the started code. Something I thought that can help me to organzie all these codes will be to create a new parent folder in my [idecs50](https://ide.cs50.io/13758b3009c14fb0964b54fd27439218). As for now I didn't type out any javsciopt codes yet because I want do this step by step, which is to write out the complex code out at first and then refactor it using loops, so that way I can see every process along my way. The very first funtemental elemnet I applied inside my `hmtl` codes is the position of geomentritic shapes. Aframe foucs a lot on positioning, because is a building struture which measn that you might see the same shape being used in many other poisitions. Looking at the introduction of Aframe and also trying out the starter codes in jsbin I learned that the positin of the shapes is determined as up/down, left/right, and close/far which is the `x y z ` of the positions. With this information I then were able to write out my first line of code which is place one cylinder at the corner as a basic of th whole house struture, but befre this I need to create the floor level which is "ground" of my struture so I kept the model code's "ground " and then build on from that point on. The first cylinder position was placed at `<a-cylinder position="-1.52 0.75 -2.53" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>`, this line of code came out to be suceesful because i want the cylinder to be placed at the bottom left from a viewer perspective if they were standing  infront of the house. Not only i want to place the geometric shape at the bottom left of the struture but i also wantg to make sure is colored in so that wi know which parft of teh codes should get looped when i refator the code. Next up is what should i learn in order to help me to move on further in with this year long freedom project during the winter break. Something i have been foucsing on a lot and thinking in my head is the second starter layer of my stretue, [here](https://recondite-elemental-sneeze.glitch.me) is the a sense of how it loks wwithout the needed geometric shapes yet. As we can see i just started the second layer of my

After learning about the fundamentals of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), I now have moved on to another stage of the freedom project , which is to apply the fundamental elements into the starting code. Something I thought that can help me to organize all these codes will be to create a new parent folder in my [idecs50](https://ide.cs50.io/13758b3009c14fb0964b54fd27439218). As for now I haven't typed out any javascript codes yet because I want to do this step by step, which is to write the complex code out at first and then refactor it using loops, so that I can see every process along my way. The very first fundamental element I applied inside my `html` codes is the position of geometric shapes. Aframe focuses a lot on positioning, because it is a building structure which means that you might see the same shape being used in many other positions. Looking at the introduction of Aframe and also trying out the starter codes in jsbin I learned that the position of the shapes is determined as up/down, left/right, and close/far which is the `x y z ` of the positions. With this information I then were able to write out my first line of code which is place one cylinder at the corner as a basic of the whole house structure, but before this I need to create the floor level which is "ground" of my structure so I kept the model code's "ground " and then build on from that point on. The first cylinder position was placed at `<a-cylinder position="-1.52 0.75 -2.53" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>`, this line of code came out to be successful because i want the cylinder to be placed at the bottom left from a viewer perspective if they were standing  in front of the house. Not only do I want to place the geometric shape at the bottom left of the structure but I also want to make sure it is colored so that we know which part of the code should get looped when I refactor the code. 

Next up is what should i learn in order to help me to move on further in with this year long freedom project during the winter break. Something I have been focusing on a lot and thinking in my head is the second starter layer of my stretue, [here](https://recondite-elemental-sneeze.glitch.me) is a sense of how it looks without the needed geometric shapes yet. As we can see i just started the second layer of the Building structure, but I am very unsure how to place the other shapes into layers, since these “floors” can be cut through which means an object will get intersected if the position is in between the plane. My first step into this winter break is to find videos that can teach me how to use the position elements within these planes so that it won’t mess up the structure of my building, not only that I also need to need find tutorial of how to make my finally project be viewed in a 360 degrees angle because whenever I edit the position inside the `aframe` website, it will allow me to serve and preview it in a way where I can view the structure at all angle, however when i serve it through the idecs50, the website only allows me to view it from the front angle with the zooming function. This is one of my main issue i need to get out of the way because it is extremely important for engineers to be able to view an online model at a 360 degree angle, without the 360 degree angle function, these engineers won’t be able to tell the people at the job side who’s doing the hardware part of the building to build or apply the correct materials so that the building is finish and safe to live. After the winter break I hope I can begin to slowly insert the geometric shapes into these layers and begin the looping process of the codes getting into the second semester.

### Content

In this blog, which is the final blog for Sep 11 Javasript course, I will be talking about the main take aways from working with the tool Aframe, and the feedbacks i got from my classmates and judges in the Sep expo. I think is blog is extremetly significant because is me reflecting on the pros and cons of my project after a long period of time, not only that, writting this blog will also allow me to come up with future ideas if i were to use this tool in my major. One of the key take away from the Sep expo is that my tool/ design is not very usuable, this is because when the freedom project was first assigned. I just want it to be avble to see a struture of a house, so I didn't think about the functionality but walking and be able to rotate the cmaerca entity. [Click here to view](https://jianzhengr3591.github.io/A-frame-house/) If you click on the link, you will see that there is really nothing much you can do with the scene because is a plain field you walk around and see a sturteur of the house. Which is something architecture engineering do, so i think is more like what major you wantr to pursue in then you can decide weather this tool is helpful and usuable for you. And here is the [pitch]([../README.md](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCqE_TWj1oGltL7FvjvLR_UKKl0HBZDm_QoFy8KfTB0/edit) i gave to my judge during the expo. If you tap in the link, you will mainly see my foucs on eletrcial engineering and artchiture, because both field require a lot of drawings and putting designs onto the paper, so this is the perfect tool for me when I step in this field but i just have to make it more usuable, which means I can make certain parts of the house touchable and pop up with a link with exanplnation of how this part of the house contritube to the support. 

Besides the takeaway I got from the expo judging, I were also able to grab some ideas from my [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uyxNZlS4XUmJh5g39wCV6zXVXbOND9EQPndQgXhXFPE/edit#slide=id.gc6f90357f_0_0). As I present my tool and my final product to the classroom, I were able to see my skills. For example in my takeaway slide I mentioned that " remember to draft before you code the scene." This was one of the greatest and strongest feedback I got from the class because I explained to my classmates that, if you want to be an engineering or any businese later on in life, make sure you plan out before you start working towards your MVP. THis was one of the mistakes I had, because I believe whenever I have new ideas I can just import into the scene but i was wrong because sometimes it won't fit the size of my base. So it is super important that you are clear of what you want to do before coding into your scene or website.

### Engineering process
Currently I am in process 7 and 8 which is imporve as needed and also communicate the result. At this point I am done with the freedom project because I made my MVP and also added on extra designs. So I am looking over the notes and my product to see where I can imporve on upcoming projects and what other approches I could've took instead of using mainly HTML. And communicate the result because when I look at my product I will ask myself why did I place this part here and why did I choose this color for this part. All these kind of question will always accur when people or myself look at the A-frame scene.

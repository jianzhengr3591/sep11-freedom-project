### Content

In this blog, which is the final blog for Sep 11 Javasript course, I will be talking about the main take aways from working with the tool Aframe, and the feedbacks i got from my classmates and judges in the Sep expo. I think is blog is extremetly significant because is me reflecting on the pros and cons of my project after a long period of time, not only that, writting this blog will also allow me to come up with future ideas if i were to use this tool in my major. One of the key take away from the Sep expo is that my tool/ design is not very usuable, this is because when the freedom project was first assigned. I just want it to be avble to see a struture of a house, so I didn't think about the functionality but walking and be able to rotate the cmaerca entity.

  Over the course of Sep9 and Sep10. I am now landed on the Sep11 which is javascrit which is data and strutrues like differnt shapes at certain positions. For this year's freedom project I want to do something different than my previous freedom projects, previous freedom project I did things related to envionmental issues and how I can create solutions to attack those issues. However this year I want to build a strutures of  "my" future house. The reason why this idea spark my mind in the Sep11 course is because I got a summer job working at an eletrical company, everyday I will touching wires and learn how power can support throught out the whole building. And sometimes because of the struture of the building, the pipes are a lot harder for wres to run throught than a stiaght pipe around the floor. So I decided to use the "Aframe" tools to streture out my "dream house" so in the future if i have the opputites to I can make things a lot more easier for myself.
  "Aframe" is a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences, this tools involves many compoents such as geometries, materials, lights, animations, models, raycasters, shadows, positional audio, text, and controls for most major headsets.[Aframe](https://aframe.io/)Here is the link to get a previou of what Aframe is about. The geometries of Aframe will be what foucs on the most, a struture of a building/house is mainly built with many differnt shapes.
